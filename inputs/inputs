I placed an order through the Burger King app on a Friday night, expecting a good experience, but I was really disappointed. The delivery took over 1 hour and 20 minutes to arrive, even though it was a regular dinner time. When the food finally came, it was cold and poorly packaged—the burger was falling apart inside the box. The fries were soggy and tasteless, as if they had been sitting out for a long time. I tried to contact customer support through the app, but I haven’t received any response so far. I’ve had good experiences before, but this one was frustrating. I’m not sure I’ll be ordering again anytime soon.

I had a great experience with Burger King recently. I ordered a Whopper meal through the app and it arrived quickly, still hot and fresh. The burger was perfectly made—the bun was soft, the patty juicy, and the vegetables crisp. The fries were crispy and well-seasoned, just the way I like them. The delivery driver was polite and the packaging kept everything intact. It’s always satisfying when your food arrives exactly as expected, and this time it even exceeded my expectations. I’ll definitely be ordering again soon!
